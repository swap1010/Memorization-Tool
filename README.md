# Memorization-Tool
It would be great to remember anything at any time. Alas, our mental capacity is limited. The good thing is that there are a lot of tools to help us memorize things. In this project, we are going to create a tool for memorizing lines, poems, speeches, and other text-based materials.
Work with the SQLAlchemy ORM and an SQLite database to create a tool for memorizing.
